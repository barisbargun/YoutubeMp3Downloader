# YoutubeMp3Downloader

In this project, I've assumed we need a video, a song etc from youtube,
get the url, convert and download the file.

Throughout the download process we get some info like
"Closing browser"
"Clicking video" 
etc.

When it completed, the browser close and the next step rename starts.
Rename step is some converter websites adds its text in the name,
and it would detect and delete.

So this is basically get url from youtube and open converter, download and rename suitably.
